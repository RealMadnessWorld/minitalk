  Objective
</h2>

In this project there will be two executables:
  - The client that sends a string to the server using UNIX signals: SIGUSER1 and SIGUSER2
  - And the server that receives the signals and converts them back to a string

The bonus part of the exercise has as an objective:
  - The server acknowledges every message received by sending back a signal to the client.
  - Supports Unicode characters

  How to use:
</h3>

- Run Makefile with:
    
      make
      
- Start server with ```./server``` and copy the pid (the server will show you the pid when you run it)

- Open a new terminal, start the client and give it the server pid and the string you want to send

After that that the text should appear on the server terminal.

For the bonus part it works exactly the same but instead of ```make``` you run ```make bonus```
